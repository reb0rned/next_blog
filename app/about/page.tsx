              Hi, Iâ€™m Dmytro, a passionate developer with a love for building
              user-friendly web applications. My journey in tech started a few
              years ago, and since then, I've fallen in love with coding,
              design, and sharing my knowledge through writing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
              experimenting with design, or writing about my experiences on this
              blog.

            My goal with this blog is to help fellow developers, designers, and
